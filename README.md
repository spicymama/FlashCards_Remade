# FlashCards_Remade
Flash Card App with Swift
I created this app for my solo project while attending DevMountain. This app allows a user to create their own flash card decks for studying. It includes a feature where the user can set a timer for how long they wish to study. When the timer runs out, it unlocks a detail view in which the user can take a break, and view SFW Reddit posts via Reddit API. Breaks are also timed and the Reddit feed is locked when that time elapses.
